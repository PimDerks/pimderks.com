title: Things I care about
date: 2016-10-07
intro: A follow-up to my previous posting, outlining subjects I'm not that interested in.

<p class="lead">Obviously, the usual suspects...</p>

I care about my girlfriend and our kids. I care about music and other forms of entertainment. I like to take a ride on my bike or to go swimming. I try to do a podcast about nothing every few weeks.

However, let's focus on my professional life. Below you'll find a list of subjects that I care about. That does not necessarily mean that I am an expert in them, just that I deeply care about, and enjoy working on them.

*__Disclaimer:__ I'm sorry if this comes across as some kind of list of buzzwords.*
