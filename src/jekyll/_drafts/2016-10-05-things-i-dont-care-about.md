intro: Lately I've been trying to focus my efforts, instead of trying to do everything.

<p class="lead">Let's make one thing clear first: the following subjects can be very important or worth spending time on when they solve a particular problem you're having.</p>
<p>It's just that <em>for me</em> they are not important enough to spend valuable time on. I'd rather spend time on challenges I enjoy working on. It makes my work and my life a whole lot easier!</p>

<pre><code>Some code.</code></pre>

<ul class="a-list-bare">
    <li>
        <h3>Animation and design</h3>
        <p>Animation and design are very hard to do well. It's not something everyone can do.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Micro-libraries focusing on doing one thing really well are the way to go.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Waterfall</h3>
        <p>Front-end development should be done in sync with design, not as an afterthought. That's the only way to use the knowledge of everyone involved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>I love working with content. Content consists of images, text, video and much more. Not just some full-screen pictures and lots of animation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Back-end development</h3>
        <p>Front-end development should be a separate deliverable in a project and should not be directly build into a .NET/PHP/whatever environment.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
