    <p>I've been building things for the internet since late 1998.
        Although I initially started as a webdesigner who also did a bit
        of <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>, but quite early on I felt
        that it was a waste of time making pictures of website. So gradually
        I focused more on front-end development and
        that's what I've been doing for the last six or seven years.
        If you're interested, take a look at <a href="/about/" class="a-cta">my work experience and education.</a>

    <p>I've always learnt a lot from other people's blogs, articles and tweets. Now I'd like to hopefully do something back, that's why I finally started writing some of my thoughts down. I've written <a href="/blog/">{{ site.posts.size }} articles</a> since starting this blog in October 2016. My latest article is <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>.</p>
