<section>
    <p class="lead">I'm a front-end developer from Nijmegen in the south-east of The Netherlands. I love to work with, discuss, <a href="#">tweet</a> and <a href="#">write</a> about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascaded Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript and other related stuff.</p>
    <p>I've been building things for the internet since late 1998. Although I initially started as a webdesigner who also did a bit of <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>, but quite early on I felt that it was a waste of time making pictures of website. So gradually I shifted more and more to <em>just</em> front-end development. That's what I've been doing for the last six or seven years. <a href="/about/">Read more about me.</a></p>
