## My job at Iquality
My job at Iquality was the 2nd time I worked at the company. Originally I started working for them in 2009 when I had just finished my education.
Although I initially started as a webdesigner, it became clear very quick that my strengths lay in the front-end development. After a couple of
years I left to work for <a href="http://www.mirabeau.nl">Mirabeau</a>, one of the bigger full-service agencies in the Netherlands.

In late 2014 after 3.5 years at Mirabeau I was offered a lead/senior front-end developer role at Iquality, which I accepted. As my girlfriend was pregnant and I had just bought a
house I felt it would be nice to work closer to home. The job itself also had lots of challenges, as Iquality had no strong
focus on front-end development since I had left, so their knowledge was starting to become a bit out of date. It would be my responsibility to once again raise the quality of the front-end development within the company and coach the junior/medior front-end
developers who were already working at the company.

### Improvements I introduced
For the last two years, that's exactly what I've been doing and I'm proud to say that a lot has changed. Some of the things I introduced in the projects we do at Iquality include:

- Front-end code as a separate deliverable
- Living styleguides
- Better re-use of CSS and JavaScript by trying to work with <abbr>OO</abbr> in mind
- Using task-runners like Grunt and Gulp
- Working content-first
- Linting code
- Vanilla JavaScript and usage of micro-libraries

However, for the last couple of months I started to feel a bit directionless at my job. A lot of the improvements I wanted were in place and this
resulted in me doing more and more 'basic' work which didn't really satisfy my needs anymore. It was time to move on. But it was not that easy.

## Impostor Syndrome

Change is not something I'm very fond of. I like being in a place where I know what to expect. I also like knowing I can deliver
what people expect of me. I like working in a way using tools and techniques I'm familiar with. All things which a new job obviously doesn't offer (at first).

There are periods where I suffer from [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) - periods where I seriously doubt my own abilities. Sometimes it gets so bad that I almost can't write a single line of code. A lot of people have written about this in the past, so I won't dedicate a whole post to it, don't worry.
When I started talking with Lukkien I once again seriously doubted about my own abilities. I really doubted if it would be
 a smart move to take a new job where I might disappoint people, whereas at Iquality people knew exactly what I could
 do for them and seemed pretty satisfied with me and my work.

 However standing still is never a good thing. Especially not in our industry, where things can change almost overnight.
 In my previous post I wrote about [picking my battles](/blog/picking-my-battles/). That post was very much inspired by the
 talks I had with the people at Lukkien where I tried to make clear what I'm passionate about in my work and what I would like to focus on when working at their company.

## Counting down the days

It took a couple of talks for the people at Lukkien to convince me that I would fit in (and be a good addition to) their team. In the end I decided that if I wanted to become better at my job change was necessary. So last week I handed in my notice and signed a contract for my new job.

Even though I'm starting to feel a bit anxious about starting a new job in just a couple of weeks, I can't wait to become an
even better front-end developer. I'm excited to be working for a company whose clients include lots of big, international brands.
I'm looking forward to working with new people who will have new insights and ideas to share. Maybe I can teach them a thing or two as well?
