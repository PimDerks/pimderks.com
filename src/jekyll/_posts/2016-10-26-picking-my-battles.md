title: Picking my battles

intro: Recently I've been thinking about what's important to me and what I like to focus on in my professional life.

Besides my job I obviously care about the usual suspects. I care about my girlfriend and [our kids](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ-3Z8MhPw_/?taken-by=pimderks1985). I care about [music](http://last.fm/user/pimd) and other forms of entertainment like [movies](https://www.icheckmovies.com/profiles/pimderks1985/) and tv-shows. I like to take a [ride on my bike](https://runkeeper.com/user/pimderks/) or to go swimming. I love doing a [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/podcast/loosch!/id1098242588?mt=2) every few weeks with my best friend.

## Specialization in jobs

However, let's focus on my professional life. When I started out the title of my job was *webdesigner* and what I had to do was pretty clear: design a pretty picture in Photoshop and then convert it to <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>. Maybe sprinkle some [MooTools](http://mootools.net/) on top of it.

Nowadays there's no such thing as a *webdesigner* anymore, that job has been divided in separate jobs. Unless you're doing relatively small projects it's become hard to do everything by yourself. Most teams will have a front-end developer, a <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> Designer, a <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Designer, maybe a copywriter etc. The list goes on and on.

I'm sure that 10 years from now those jobs will have become even more specialized: there are not many people who can build an app in React, but can also create beautiful 3D-animations in <abbr>CSS</abbr> and make them accessible as well.

Recently I've been thinking about what I really care about, trying to pick my battles. Below you'll find a list of subjects that I care about. That does not necessarily mean that I am an expert in them, just that I deeply care about, and enjoy working on them.

*__Disclaimer:__ I'm sorry if this comes across as some kind of list of buzzwords.*

## The battles I picked

### Scalability
Smart reuse of CSS, HTML and JavaScript makes websites fast, consistent and responsive. I was quite an
early adopter of BEM and am very interested in topics like [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [ITCSS](http://itcss.io/) and similar
methodologies to create scalable and maintainable <abbr>CSS</abbr>.

### Performance
Time is money and faster is better. Users love websites or apps that are fast, responsive and snappy. Conditionally loading assets and behaviour
([ConditionerJS](http://conditionerjs.com)), responsive images, optimizing the rendering of websites - this stuff fascinates me. It's a shame that I
don't have enough time to bring everything I read and learn about into practice though. As I said before, sometimes you have to pick your battles.

### Consistency
Styleguides, grids and vertical rhythm are just some of the tools that can be used to build consistent UIs. I think a major part of
a front-end developers job is making sure there is consistency in a website. When talking about consistency I'm not only talking about
 using the same button style everywhere, but also about topics like:

- Vertical rhythm
- Consistent paddings and margins
- Typographical scale

Consistency is important for everyone, from the client, to the developers and of course the end-user. A <abbr>UI</abbr> should do what
the user expects it to do on every single page. If a UI-component behaves and looks differently between pages, you're doing something wrong.

### Accessibility
I try to make sure that whatever I build is accessible for everyone. People using the keyboard should still be
able to tab through a [carousel](http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/), people using a screenreader should still be able to make sense of a page and the
 contrast on a page should be sufficient so that people with poor eyesight or colorblindness will still be able to use it. Techniques like
 <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> can help with making complex interfaces or components accessible.

### Content
Good content is still king. The use of semantic HTML and micro-data makes sure that your content can be correctly identified and used, both by humans and machines.
I think it's very important to think about content (and thus <abbr>HTML</abbr>!) structures as early as possible in a project.

This way you can make sure that everyone
 has a clear view of what content will be expected so you won't have to deal with 'lorem ipsum' dummy data. Please note that I'm talking about content *structures*,
 not the *actual* content.

 Another advantage of thinking about structures early on is the ability to use structured data techniques like microdata or <abbr title="Resource Description Framework in Attributes">RDFa</abbr>
 from the start of your project instead of trying to add it later on.

### Simplicity

Simple is good. UI should not be complex and should behave as expected. The less code needed, the better. Every time someone designs a custom select-box, reinvents inputs a puppy dies or tries to add something which hacks the scroll a puppy dies.

It's our job as front-end developer to make sure we keep things as simple as possible. A user not being able to use your website because the "Add to cart"-button is not really a `button` but a `span` will cost you money. No-one has ever purchased
something because the website had such fancy animations when scrolling down. Again - pick your battles!

## Final thoughts

Obviously this is just the top of the iceberg. There's tons of other stuff that I care about as well, like coding conventions, automation, testing  etc. There's also a lot of stuff I __don't__ care about. That's something I'll write about in a post next month. [Let me know](/contact/) what you think about the battles I chose to fight!
