<p class="lead">In 2016 I visited the Fronteers conference for the sixth time in a row. You can read my note in an earlier
post on this website.</p>

## Shifting thoughts

Fronteers is one of the most popular conferences about front-end technology. Deservedly so.
The organisation is sublime in everything, ranging from the speakers to the lovely merchandise.
It is always something I look forward to during the year.

Especially when I was just starting in the industry Fronteers was something where my mind was
 blown. Almost every speaker had awesome examples, demos and other cool stuff. I always left thinking
 "OMG WTF I can never do that!". The 2015 and 2016 conferences did not do that for me, unfortunately.

## Reasons

One of the reasons for that is probably that I finally decided to try and focus on a couple of subjects
which I care about, instead of trying to do a bit of everything. The result is that I already have quite
some knowledge about responsive CSS, WAI-ARIA and other techniques. Presentations about animation or
data-visualisation are nice for the first 10-15 minutes to me, but after that I get bored quite easily.

### I like specialized stuff

The conclusion to me is that maybe a conference like CSS Day is better and more interesting for me.
It's focus on very specific subjects instead of trying to cover a bit of everything appeals to me. I
know that when I visited CSS Day 2015 I didn't leave with a feeling of 'what did *that* have to do with
front-end development?' like I've done multiple times during Fronteers.
